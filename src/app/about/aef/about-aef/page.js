        About Alva’s Education Foundation
      </h1>

      <p>
        Dr. M Mohan Alva set up an Ayurvedic clinic in Moodubidire in 1980 to cater to the basic health needs of the people of his village. The clinic responded to the then prevalent main health issue like snake bite. He started Alva’s Pharmacy in 1982 to produce the necessary medicines. The clinic was upgraded from time to time responding to the need of the hour and Alva’s Health Center, a full-fledged multi speciality hospital came into existence in 1986. After finding the solutions for the health needs, Dr. Alva diverted his attention to the idea of serving the society. He realized the need for creating job opportunities for the rural youth. He started the Paramedical courses to support the health needs and to help the youth to find jobs very easily. Alva’s Education Foundation came into existence in 1995 with Alva’s Institute of Nursing and Physiotherapy. Nursing College and Ayurvedic Medical Colleges were added in 1996.

        Dr. Alva started Alva’s P.U. College and Alva’s Degree College in 1998 to bring about innovative changes in the field of education. The good old colleges of undivided D.K. District had failed to upgrade and respond to the educational needs of the modern society. So, he initiated the coaching for the national level exams along with NCERT syllabus. With this, Ekalavya Sports Club also flourished. Dr. Alva felt that just 6 hours class room teaching alone will not enable the overall development of the students. So to make the students remain in the campus for all 24 hours of the day, he brought the hostel system to the forefront. Effective coaching for the competitive entrance exams like CET, NEET, JEE, JEE Crash course, KVPY, NDA, NATA, CA-Foundation, C.S., CLAT, KAS, IAS etc, were also introduced. Alva’s also has the credit of introducing the different educational possibilities like bridge course, crash course, vacation coaching, study materials etc. In order to make the students strong enough to compete with the reputed college students of other states, effective coaching was given in NEET/NEET Long term courses. As a result, the students are bringing laurels to the institution through their exemplary achievements. Every year more than 300 students getting qualified for Medical Education is a testimony to the greatness of the institution. This year, the system is modified further by dividing the whole student strength of the college into 12 Blocks including Science, Commerce, Arts and NEET Long term to ensure individual attention to every student.
