        Dr. M. Mohan Alva, Chairman of Alva’s Education Foundation, is a keen sports lover and promoter.
        With a vision to encourage sports, he started the Alva’s Ekalavya Club in 1985. Students were
        given free education and coaching. As the foundation grew, a permanent sports hostel was
        established, and since 1995, more than 3000 students have received free education and coaching
        under the sports quota in various disciplines. Qualified coaches provide special training.
        Many national and international athletes have been produced by the foundation.
